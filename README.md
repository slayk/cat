# Cat-i-Facts

Made this static website for my unconditional love for cats. 
- This website is made using HTML ans CSS.
- This wesbite consists of three images, with three random facts and one liners.
- The background as well as the one liners and face keep moving.
- The screen keeps changing after every 10 seconds.
- It is highly recommended that you open this site on your desktop as the website is not responsive.

Hope you enjoy getting to know about these precious little creatures.

Do check out the final outcome - My site is published at : https://slayk.github.io/cat/
